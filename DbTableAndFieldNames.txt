Sprint 2
for sprint 2 the DB will get a major update, which will affect many of the queries.
changes,

0. Introduce new table for group sets (GROUPSET), which will generally replace the TEACHEDBY table and add a new db relation to GRADES.
In short, the teacher will be assigned to sets, instead of modules, and each module will have at least 1 set.
After all the structure will be similar to the old TEACHEDBY table.

1. GRADES will get some new fields to meet the requirements to implement ATTENDANCE. ALso a new

2. ATTENDANCE will bring in at least 2, more likely 3 new fields.
ATTENDANCE intended to track daily attendance to each student.
The idea is one field will hold one single integer starts from 0, and add exaclty 1 to it with every successful attendance check.
The second field will track every attendance check done by the teacher. The third  field supposedly will hold the date of
the last performed attendance check, to restrict multiple checks per week. Dumb simple way, but hopefully will serve the purpose.

3. TEACHER table will change regading it's fields, now it's kind of copy of STUDENT table. Some data will be removed (DoB)

4. Same for STUDENT table. Both intended to reduce data to a bare minimum required for our purpose.
(originally I designed the tables to hold data for generating ID's and such for future data INSERTS, since we don't have
to do that, no need for some fields any more)
Also studentID will be shortened.
